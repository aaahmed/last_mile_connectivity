# Finding the intersection route of Public transport to know the demand and supply of mobility. ( last_mile_connectivity )
## Objective
The major problem which metro cities face is the unavailability of direct public transportation from one point of a city to the other. In order to reach a certain destination, people need to switch to various modes of transportation which is really time-consuming as well as a hectic task.

## Solution
There must be a point of location where people frequently change their buses in order to reach their destinations. We need to locate such points and set up rental Bike Stations so that it gets easier for people to take rental rides and reach their destination at a faster rate than usual. This also increases the chance of rental Bikes being used as a medium of transport to reach their destination. The set up of rental Bike stations at such locations also eases the daily commute of people by making their arrivals early.
